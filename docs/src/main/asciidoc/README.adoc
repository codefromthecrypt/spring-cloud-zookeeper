[[zookeeper-overview]]
= Zookeeper overview

ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.
See the
https://zookeeper.apache.org[Zookeeper site] for more information.
Spring Cloud Zookeeper also builds on the https://curator.apache.org[Apache Curator] project, which started life at Netflix.

[[spring-cloud-zookeeper-features]]
= Spring Cloud Zookeeper Features

Spring Cloud Zookeeper includes the following features:

* Spring Cloud `DiscoveryClient` implementation (supports Spring Cloud LoadBalancer)
* Zookeeper-based `PropertySource` loaded during the 'bootstrap' phase

= Running the Sample

. https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_Download[Install
zookeeper] (On a mac with homebrew, use `brew install zookeeper`).
. https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_InstallingSingleMode[Start
zookeeper].
. https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_ConnectingToZooKeeper[Verify
zookeeper is running].
. Run `mvn --settings .settings.xml package`.
Doing so brings in the required Spring Cloud Maven repositories and Build.
. Run `java -jar spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample/target/spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample-1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
. Visit http://localhost:8080 to verify that `{"serviceId":"testZookeeperApp","host":"<yourhost>","port":8080}` works.
. Run `java -jar spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample/target/spring-cloud-zookeeper-sample-1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081`
. Visit http://localhost:8080 again to verify that `{"serviceId":"testZookeeperApp","host":"<yourhost>","port":8081}` eventually shows up in the results in a round-robin fashion. (It may take a minute or so.)
