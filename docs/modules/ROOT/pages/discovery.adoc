= Service Discovery with Zookeeper

Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to
hand-configure each client or some form of convention can be difficult to do and can be
brittle. https://curator.apache.org[Curator](A Java library for Zookeeper) provides Service
Discovery through a https://curator.apache.org/curator-x-discovery/[Service Discovery
Extension]. Spring Cloud Zookeeper uses this extension for service registration and
discovery.

[[activating]]
== Activating

Including a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery` enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Discovery.

NOTE: For web functionality, you still need to include
`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web`.

CAUTION: When working with version 3.4 of Zookeeper you need to change
the way you include the dependency as described xref:install.adoc[here].

[[registering-with-zookeeper]]
== Registering with Zookeeper

When a client registers with Zookeeper, it provides metadata (such as host and port, ID,
and name) about itself.

The following example shows a Zookeeper client:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class Application {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello world";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(true).run(args);
    }

}
----

NOTE: The preceding example is a normal Spring Boot application.

If Zookeeper is located somewhere other than `localhost:2181`, the configuration must
provide the location of the server, as shown in the following example:

[source,yml,indent=0]
.application.yml
----
spring:
  cloud:
    zookeeper:
      connect-string: localhost:2181
----

CAUTION: If you use xref:config.adoc[Spring Cloud Zookeeper Config], the
values shown in the preceding example need to be in `bootstrap.yml` instead of
`application.yml`.

The default service name, instance ID, and port (taken from the `Environment`) are
`${spring.application.name}`, the Spring Context ID, and `${server.port}`, respectively.

Having `spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery` on the classpath makes the app into both
a Zookeeper "`service`" (that is, it registers itself) and a "`client`" (that is, it can
query Zookeeper to locate other services).

If you would like to disable the Zookeeper Discovery Client, you can set
`spring.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.enabled` to `false`.

[[using-the-discoveryclient]]
== Using the DiscoveryClient

Spring Cloud has support for
https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-openfeign/docs/current/reference/html/[OpenFeign]
(a REST client builder), `RestTemplate` and `WebClient` via https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/spring-cloud-commons/loadbalancer.html#spring-cloud-loadbalancer-integrations[Spring Cloud Loadbalancer], using logical service names instead of physical URLs.

You can also use the `org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient`, which
provides a simple API for discovery clients that is not specific to Netflix, as shown in
the following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

public String serviceUrl() {
    List<ServiceInstance> list = discoveryClient.getInstances("STORES");
    if (list != null && list.size() > 0 ) {
        return list.get(0).getUri().toString();
    }
    return null;
}
