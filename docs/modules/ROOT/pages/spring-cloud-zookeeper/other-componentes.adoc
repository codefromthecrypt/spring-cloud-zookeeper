Feign, Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer all work with Spring Cloud Zookeeper.

== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer with Zookeeper

Spring Cloud Zookeeper provides an implementation of Spring Cloud LoadBalancer `ServiceInstanceListSupplier`.
When you use the  `spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery`, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is autoconfigured to use the
`ZookeeperServiceInstanceListSupplier` by default.

TIP: If you were previously using the StickyRule in Zookeeper, its replacement in the current stack
is the `SameInstancePreferenceServiceInstanceListSupplier` in SC LoadBalancer. You can read on how to set it up in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#spring-cloud-loadbalancer[Spring Cloud Commons documentation].
