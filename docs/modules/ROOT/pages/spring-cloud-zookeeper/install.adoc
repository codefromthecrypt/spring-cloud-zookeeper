= Install Zookeeper

See the https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html[installation
documentation] for instructions on how to install Zookeeper.

Spring Cloud Zookeeper uses Apache Curator behind the scenes.
While Zookeeper 3.5.x is still considered "beta" by the Zookeeper development team,
the reality is that it is used in production by many users.
However, Zookeeper 3.4.x is also used in production.
Prior to Apache Curator 4.0, both versions of Zookeeper were supported via two versions of Apache Curator.
Starting with Curator 4.0 both versions of Zookeeper are supported via the same Curator libraries.

In case you are integrating with version 3.4 you need to change the Zookeeper dependency
that comes shipped with `curator`, and thus `spring-cloud-zookeeper`.
To do so simply exclude that dependency and add the 3.4.x version like shown below.
