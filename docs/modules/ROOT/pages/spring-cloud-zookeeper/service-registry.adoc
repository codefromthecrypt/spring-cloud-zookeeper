= Spring Cloud Zookeeper and Service Registry

Spring Cloud Zookeeper implements the `ServiceRegistry` interface, letting developers
register arbitrary services in a programmatic way.

The `ServiceInstanceRegistration` class offers a `builder()` method to create a
`Registration` object that can be used by the `ServiceRegistry`, as shown in the following
example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Autowired
private ZookeeperServiceRegistry serviceRegistry;

public void registerThings() {
    ZookeeperRegistration registration = ServiceInstanceRegistration.builder()
            .defaultUriSpec()
            .address("anyUrl")
            .port(10)
            .name("/a/b/c/d/anotherservice")
            .build();
    this.serviceRegistry.register(registration);
}

[[instance-status]]
== Instance Status

Netflix Eureka supports having instances that are `OUT_OF_SERVICE` registered with the server.
These instances are not returned as active service instances.
This is useful for behaviors such as blue/green deployments.
(Note that the Curator Service Discovery recipe does not support this behavior.) Taking advantage of the flexible payload has let Spring Cloud Zookeeper implement `OUT_OF_SERVICE` by updating some specific metadata and then filtering on that metadata in the Spring Cloud LoadBalancer `ZookeeperServiceInstanceListSupplier`.
The `ZookeeperServiceInstanceListSupplier` filters out all non-null instance statuses that do not equal `UP`.
If the instance status field is empty, it is considered to be `UP` for backwards compatibility.
To change the status of an instance, make a `POST` with `OUT_OF_SERVICE` to the `ServiceRegistry`
instance status actuator endpoint, as shown in the following example:

[source,sh,indent=0]
----
$ http POST http://localhost:8081/service-registry status=OUT_OF_SERVICE
----

NOTE: The preceding example uses the `http` command from https://httpie.org.
